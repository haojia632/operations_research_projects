This is a repository for projects completed in my operations research class during the penultimate semester of my Masters of Science program in Data Analytics at George Mason University.

<h2>Hmwk1</h2>
<b>Web Scraper for Disney World Rides</b> <br />
This script scrapes ride times for my 'favorite' rides and inserts them into a database, every 15 minutes.

<h2>Hmwk2</h2>
<b>McDonalds Web Scraper</b> <br />
This script scrapes the locations of all Mcdonalds in the country from the Menuism site and loads them in a database. I, then, map out a number of New York McDonalds by distance 
and various parameters.
